    "# Introduction\n",
    "The building sector represents 44% of the energy consumed in France, far ahead of the transport sector. Each year, the building sector emits more than 123 million tons of C02, which makes it one of the key areas in the fight against global warming and the energy transition.<br>\n",
    "In this BE :\n",
    "- We will discuss the influence of different parameters in the behavior of a simple building, based on a code previously developed.\n",
    "We will study four cases :\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1. The four rooms are controlled by a HVAC system at the setpoint temperatures 20 °C, 20 °C, 22 °C, 18 °C for rooms 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively and that the there is no solar radiation on the walls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2. We consider that there is solar radiation absorbed by the walls and that rooms 1 and 3 are controlled by a HVAC system while rooms 2 and 4 are in \"free-running\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Case 3. Room 2 is ventilated with an air-flow rate of $ACH = 1 \\, \\mathrm{volume /hour}$ (ACH is the number of air-changes per hour). The density and specific heat of the air are $\\rho = 1.2 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$ and $c = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{J/(kg \\, K)}$, respectively). The outdoor air enters in room 2, then is moves to room 4 and, from here, it gets outdoors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 4. The air-flow in room 2 is reversed: from outdoors, the air enters in room 4, then it moves to room 2, from which it gets outdoors. Considering that the air flow rate of room 2 is the same as before (i.e., $ACH = 1 \\, \\mathrm{volume /hour}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to discuss the influence of different parameters, such as ventilation, materials and solar radiation on the thermal loads and the temperatures of the indoor air of the rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, we will focus on the modeling of a more complex architecture, resulting from the TET option project \"Ferme du Milieu à Lhuis\". \n"

    "The materials used to constitute the walls is a first important parameter to ensure the thermal comfort of the users in a building, and to reduce the energy to use to control the temperature of the rooms. The main characteristic of a material that can influence the thermal behavior of a building is its conductivity: this can vary greatly from one material to another. Concrete, for example, has a conductivity of about 1.7 W/(mK), while wood is almost 10 times less conductive on average, with conductivities ranging from 0.1 W/(mK) to 0.2 W/(mK). [ref : http://www.ganeeva.fr/]\n",

    "However, conductivity alone is not sufficient to compare two materials: it is the resistance, defined by equation [eq], and which therefore also depends on the wall thickness, that is of physical importance. Since wall thickness is largely determined by mechanical strength constraints, two materials cannot be properly compared using the same wall thickness value. \n",

These solutions will be compared in two different contexts : in winter and summer, by using the values associated with it in the introduction of the report.  Wall thicknesses typical of their practical use will be used. In the particular case of raw earth, the thickness used for the calculations corresponds to the required wall thickness to obtain the same mechanical resistance as a 15cm-wide regular concrete wall.  In this modelisation, all the rooms are controlled in temperature, according to the default parameters defined earlier. It should be noted that this simulation is only a model to compare approximately different types of facade materials. In practice, the walls are also insulated, which is why the values obtained are relatively high.\n",

Overall, conventional materials such as steel and concrete have a rather poor thermal behavior, while wood and raw earth have good thermal properties.

    "## Influence of ventilation\n",
    "The ventilation of a building is essential to ensure the comfort of its users, by controlling the air quality and humidity of the building. This phenomenon also has a significant influence on the thermal performance of the building and must therefore be taken into account in the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the influence of ventilation on the thermal management of the building, we will proceed by carrying out two types of modeling: the calculation of the thermal flows necessary to control the temperature of the building as a function of the ventilation rate, and the calculation of the interior temperatures (uncontrolled) in the presence of ventilation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Influence of the ventilation rate on the thermal flows\n",
    "\n",
    "For this calculation, we will take the default parameters defined in the introduction, in winter and in summer. We will calculate the control heat flows in each room, for ventilation rate values of 0.5 vol/h, 1 vol/h and 2 vol/h. In this modelisation, air is entering in the building from room 2 and going out outside in room 4. The results are presented in the following tables: \n",
    "\n",
    "Winter : E = 200 W/m², T0 = 0°C : <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/Ventilation_winter.png\" alt=\"isolated\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Summer : E = 400 W/m², T0 = 30°C : <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/Ventilation_summer.png\" alt=\"isolated\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can therefore see that, in summer as in winter, the phenomenon of natural ventilation globally increases the energy to be used to maintain the temperature of the rooms, with heating in winter and with air conditioning in summer. Indeed, the outside temperature being colder than the control temperature in winter, and warmer in summer, the contribution of a mass of air inside the building leads to an additional heat flow by convection which is the opposite of that produced by the regulators. From a purely energy point of view, the ventilation of outside air represents an additional cost. Natural ventilation can therefore be interesting provided that the air used does not have a temperature difference that is too great in relation to the control temperatures of the rooms, which can be achieved using technologies such as the Canadian well."
